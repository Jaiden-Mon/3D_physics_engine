Hii!

My name is Jaiden and this is my project.

I'm trying to make a 3D physics engine in c++, don't spect a high-quality code, although I try my best upon doing so.

Firstly, I defined a Vector3 struct, with constructors and operators(such as dot and cross products), which allow me to do really cool things with 3D vectors, like calculating movement, acceleration or gravity.

Secondly, I made 3x3 matrices (which were slightly complicated), so that I could do things like 3D rotations, movement and angular momentum.

I implemented quaternions, which are highly used in physics for things like 3D orientation.

Aand that's it for now.

Currently working on the physics part, implemented a RigidBody and a World, which together manage how a simple sphere behaves upon forces like gravity. 

I haven't yet implemented a grapher (I cant decide between SFML and OpenGL), but for now it works fine.

Happy Valentines!

It's been a while, but I finally have collisions working(kinda), because apparently I know how to do  vectorial calculus, but not make to balls bounce.

Aand that's it for today, see ya!
