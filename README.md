Hii!

My name is Jaiden and this is my proyect.

I'm trying to make a 3D physics engine in c++, do not spect a high-quality code, although I try my best upon doing so.

—————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Firstly, I defined a Vector3 struct, with constructors and operators(such as dot and cross products), which allow me to do really cool things with 3D vectors, like calculating movement, acceleration or gravity.

Secondly, I made 3x3 matrices (which were slightly complicated), so that I could do things like 3D rotations.

Then I did the Quaternions, which are highly used in physics for things like orientations.

Aand thats it for now.
